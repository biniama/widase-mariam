To all my Friends:

Good News:

I have developed a Widase Mariam | ውዳሴ ማርያም (የድንግል ማርያም ውዳሴ | ውዳሴሃ ለእግዝትነ ማርያም ወላዲተ አምላክ) Android Mobile/Tablet Application.

From now on, you can read/pray Widase Mariam in Amharic or Ge'ez or English from your mobile or tablet.

You can find the application and installation information at http://habeshaapps.yolasite.com/
