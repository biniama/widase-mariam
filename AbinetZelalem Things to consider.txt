Things to consider

navigation - use current drawer navigation(use fragments with android support library)

buttons dont have native feel, dont use rounded corners, if you need it use the theme rounds, the curves on your app are too much

color - too many colors ( use theme holo light). 

background - i would suggest  =you use a solid color

font size - English text size should be smaller. (use sp and dp to define size)
